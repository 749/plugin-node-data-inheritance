# Data Inheritance Plugin for Pattern Lab Node

The Data Inheritance Plugin allows patterns to inherit data from patterns within its lineage.
This means that data from included patterns is merged with the current pattern. The current pattern's data takes precedence.

## Compatibility
This version of the plugin is tested to be compatible with [@pattern-lab/patternlab-node v5.9.2](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/v5.9.2). It will likely be compatible with future v5.* version.

For [@pattern-lab/patternlab-node v2.12](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/v2.12.0) please refer to version 1.* of this plugin.

## Installation

To add the Data Inheritance Plugin to your project using [npm](http://npmjs.com/):
```bash
npm install --save git+https://github.com/749/plugin-node-data-inheritance.git
npm run pl:install plugin-node-data-inheritance
```
